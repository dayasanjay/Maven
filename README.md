--> All the open source communities  like  Jenkins, tomcat, mysql etc upload their updated API's into maven global server ( search.maven.org )<br>
--> Developers  connect to  the maven global server, download those<br>
--> API  that are necessary for the project development and store them in  Maven local repository<br>
--> All  developers connect   to  maven local repository and perform the development activity<br>
--> In this way, the code is stored separately in github. and API's required for code development are stored in maven local repository<br>
--> This will help in protecting the code from any threats/viruses that might be present in the  API's<br>
***Maven  is also a build tool. Where it can compile the programs and create an artifact.<br>
