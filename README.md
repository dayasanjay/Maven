### What is Maven ?
***It is product of apache.<br>
*** All the open source communities  like  Jenkins, tomcat, mysql etc upload their updated API's into maven global server ( search.maven.org )<br>
Developers  connect to  the maven global server, download those
API  that are necessary for the project development and store them in  Maven local repository.
All  developers connect   to  maven local repository and perform the development activity.
In this way, the code is stored separately in github. and API's required for code development are stored in maven local repository.
This will help in protecting the code from any threats/viruses that might be present in the  API's.
Maven  is also a build tool. Where it can compile the programs and create a artifact.
